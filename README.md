  ## _What is pokedex ?_
  Pokemon is a web aplication that provides a variety of informations about the original 151 Pokemon and furthermore to a total of 1010 Pokemons.
  
  For each Pokemon have been created a card where beside the image of the Pokemon, the user is informed with the name and the coresponding element / elements type. 
  The user can access further information by clicking on any of the card. By doing that, the user access the "General info" or to the "Main ststs" of the selected Pokemon.
