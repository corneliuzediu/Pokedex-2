  ## _Why Pokedex ?_
  This is my Final Project as part of CS50X Course, based on [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
  
  ## _What is pokedex ?_
  Pokemon is a web aplication that provides a variety of informations about the original 151 Pokemon and furthermore to a total of 1010 Pokemons. 
  
  For each Pokemon have been created a card where beside the image of the Pokemon, the user is informed with the name and the coresponding element / elements type. 
  The user can access further information by clicking on any of the card. By doing that, the user access the "General info" or to the "Main ststs" of the selected Pokemon.
  
| General Info                               | Main stats |
|:---                                       |:---     |
| Species | Health |
| Height| Attack |
| Weight | Defense |
| Abilities | Special-Attack |
|  | Special-Defense |
|  | Speed |


  The user have the possibility of searching any particular Pokemon out of the initial 151 Pokemnon or from the full list, by switching between "Get all Pokemons" or "Get the initial Pokemons". The search will take any text input and will display any Pokemon that have the coresponding input into the name. 

  ### Example:
  If the user introduce "char" into the search field, depedending on the desired search mode, the outcome will be as followed:
  #### The initial 151 Pokemon list:
  |Pokemon #                        | Name | Elements|
|:---                                       |:---      |:---     |
